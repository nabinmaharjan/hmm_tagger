The Northern Irishman will pit his tactical wits against Louis van Gaal at Anfield knowing that three points for the Reds would lift them above their rivals in the congested table .
It 's an altogether different scenario to the one on the day the sides last met , back in December , when United claimed a 3-0 win at Old Trafford that did n't tell the full story .
Liverpool 's new 3-4-3 system was effective in many areas that afternoon and has provided a platform for Rodger s' charges to go unbeaten in the Barclays Premier League ever since .
" It 's an important game , " the manager commented today. " These games in particular are always great spectacles and obviously the rivalry is historic .
" It 's a game at Anfield against a big rival and we want to win the game .
" I do n't think the result will be an overriding factor because there are still a number of games to go , but certainly psychologically it can give you a great boost . "
